# About

Welcome to my blog.

I'm Vince and I am a data scientist and machine learning developer. I got my start in tech through online courses and a few books. My obsessions include the latest developments in holographic glasses, digital coins, robots, space travel, new ways of consumption, and self-improvement. In addition, I like to keep up with developments in software engineering as that is the foundation behind deep tech domains such as machine learning.

My fascination with artificial intelligence may have begun when I was growing up while being exposed to cheesy 90s science fiction with humanoid robots and their monotone voices. Today, we see AI being applied to medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, finances, and other emerging applications.

My goal is to build solutions of tremendous value as we have increasing access to new skills and technologies to do good.
