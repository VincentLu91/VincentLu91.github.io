# About

Welcome to my blog.

I am a data scientist, machine learning developer, and deep tech enthusiast. I got my start in tech through online courses and a few books. My obsessions include the latest developments in holographic glasses, robots, space travel, new ways of consumption, and self-improvement. In addition, I like to keep up with developments in software engineering as that is the foundation behind deep tech domains such as machine learning.

My fascination with artificial intelligence may have begun when I was growing up while being exposed to cheesy 90s science fiction with humanoid robots and their monotone voices. Today, we see AI being applied to medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, finances, and other emerging applications.

While we on their way to reach AGI, my belief is that AI will fundamentally transform everything we've been conditioned about the world to be true. With continued research in ground-breaking domains, AI will increasingly permeate into other domains that will become essential to societies and improve our quality of lives.

There are two core motivating factors that drive me to pursue artificial intelligence: efficiency and automation. Just as the Internet has brought about increasing speed of access to information, so will AI bring us increasing speed of convenience in our day to day lives. Moreover, my bet is that AI will converge with other exciting technologies to bring about innovative breakthroughs.

My goal is to create AI solutions that will enable efficiency and automation in our day to day lives. There has never been a better time to solve problems that have long been unsolved before.
