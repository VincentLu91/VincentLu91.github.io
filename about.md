# About

Welcome to my blog.

I'm Vince and I am a data scientist and machine learning developer. Like most geeks, I got my start in tech through online courses and a few books. Besides coding by my computer, I'd find myself lost in articles about the latest developments in holographic glasses, digital coins, robots, space travel, new ways of consumption, and self-improvement.

My fascination with artificial intelligence may have begun when I was growing up being exposed to cheesy 90s science fiction pop culture - you know, the humanoid robots that had tin-foil heads and speak with that monotone voice. Today, we see AI being applied to medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, finances, and many other domains.

I decided to build a hub of my own to share projects, learnings and insights, and developments in today's technological wizardries.

In addition to my focus on data science, machine learning, and AI, I am also currently returning to polish a skillset around web development and software engineering.

When I'm not doing serious work, I certainly go out for a drive to clear my head and try new hobbies.
