# About

Welcome to my blog.

I'm Vince and I am a data scientist and machine learning developer. Like most geeks, I got my start in tech through online courses and a few books. My obsessions include the latest developments in holographic glasses, digital coins, robots, space travel, new ways of consumption, and self-improvement.

My fascination with artificial intelligence may have begun when I was growing up while being exposed to cheesy 90s science fiction with humanoid robots and their monotone voices. Today, we see AI being applied to medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, finances, and other emerging applications.

In addition to my focus on data science, machine learning, and AI, I am also currently returning to polish a skillset around web development and software engineering. I hope to explore other deep tech domains when time allows.
