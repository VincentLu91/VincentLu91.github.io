# This is my first blog!

I've never been keen on making introductory posts, but there's a first time for everything!

In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, I hope that each of you reading this stay safe and healthy. Together we will get through this unexpectedly difficult time.

One way of making the most out of this time is to invest in yourself and start pursuing a hobby or passion that you've been putting for so long. I'm finishing an online course in web development that I have not been able to continue in the last 4 months as they are critical skills to build good products that can solve business problems.

I'm also planning to finish my long awaited goal of reading a whopping stack of business books. While I have read a few business books and saw how businesses work through work experience, there is so much to pour through to master critical skills in business that will serve me well, no matter the industry.

Rather than setting new goals in New Years Resolutions, I always commit to finishing what I've started. The pandemic, while devastating to our world's economies and our personal wellbeing, is also a reminder what we've set for ourselves and why we commit ourselves to it in the first place. And I've made it my decision to come away stronger and wiser.

That's it for today's post. I wish you well!
